# 🌟 Episode 12: Let's Build Our Store 🏬

Welcome to Episode 12 of my React journey! In this episode, we explored state management using Redux, including its setup, slices, actions, and selectors. Let’s dive into the key concepts and learnings! 🚀

## 📚 Key Learnings

### Part 1: Understanding Redux and State Management 📦

- **Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is not mandatory for all applications but becomes essential for large-scale applications where state management can get complex.
- **React and Redux** are separate libraries, meaning you can use Redux with any JavaScript framework, not just React.
- Alternatives to Redux include **Zustand**, a small, fast state management library that provides a simpler API.

### Part 2: Exploring Redux Toolkit and React-Redux 🔍

- We explored the official Redux Toolkit website and its documentation, which provides a simplified approach to using Redux.
- **Redux Toolkit** helps streamline the process of setting up Redux in your application by providing a set of tools and best practices.

### Part 3: Redux Store and Slices 🗂️

- A **Redux store** holds the state of your application, and it contains **slices** that manage specific pieces of state (e.g., user, cart).
- When you want to modify the state (e.g., adding an item to the cart), you dispatch an **action** that calls a **reducer** function to update the state.

#### Important Note
**When you press the add button, it dispatches an action which calls the reducer function that updates the slice of our Redux store.**

- To read data from the store, we use **selectors**, which allow us to subscribe to specific parts of the store and update our components accordingly.

### Part 4: Setting Up Redux Toolkit 🛠️

1. **Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux**:
   To get started, you need to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
   ```

2. **Build the Store**:
   - Create an `AppStore.js` file in the `utils` folder.
   - Use the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit to create the store.

   ```javascript
   // utils/AppStore.js
   import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
   import cartReducer from './CartSlice';

   const store = configureStore({
     reducer: {
       cart: cartReducer,
     },
   });

   export default store;
   ```

3. **Wrap Your Application**:
   - Use the `Provider` component from React-Redux to wrap your application and pass the store as a prop.

   ```javascript
   // index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
   import store from './utils/AppStore';
   import App from './App';

   ReactDOM.render(
     <Provider store={store}>
       <App />
     </Provider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

4. **Create a Slice (CartSlice)**:
   - Create a file named `CartSlice.js` and define your slice using `createSlice`.

   ```javascript
   // utils/CartSlice.js
   import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

   const cartSlice = createSlice({
     name: 'cart',
     initialState: {
       items: [],
     },
     reducers: {
       addItem: (state, action) => {
         state.items.push(action.payload);
       },
       removeItem: (state, action) => {
         state.items = state.items.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
       },
     },
   });

   export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;
   export default cartSlice.reducer;
   ```

5. **Dispatch an Action**:
   - Use the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions from your components.

   ```javascript
   // components/ItemList.js
   import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
   import { addItem } from '../utils/CartSlice';

   const ItemList = ({ item }) => {
     const dispatch = useDispatch();

     const handleAddItem = () => {
       dispatch(addItem(item));
     };

     return <button onClick={handleAddItem}>Add to Cart</button>;
   };
   ```

6. **Update the Cart with Selectors**:
   - Use the `useSelector` hook to read data from the store.

   ```javascript
   // components/Cart.js
   import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

   const Cart = () => {
     const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items);

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Your Cart</h2>
         {cartItems.length === 0 ? (
           <p>No items in the cart.</p>
         ) : (
           cartItems.map((item) => (
             <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
           ))
         )}
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

### Part 5: Creating a Cart Page 🛒

- We created a cart page to display all items in the cart, including:
  - Creating a route for the cart page.
  - Adding a link from the header to navigate to the cart.
  - Creating a card component to display cart items.

#### Example of Cart Page Route
```javascript
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Cart from './components/Cart';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/cart">Cart</Link>
    </nav>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/cart" component={Cart} />
      {/* Other routes */}
    </Switch>
  </Router>
);
```

### Part 6: Understanding Reducers and Slices ⚙️

- **Reducers**: When creating a store, you define a main reducer that can contain smaller reducers (slices).
- **Slices**: Each slice can have multiple reducer functions, which are combined into a single reducer when exported.

### Part 7: State Mutation in Redux 🛑

- In older versions of Redux, you had to create a copy of the state to update it. With Redux Toolkit, you can mutate the state directly, thanks to Immer.js.

#### Example of State Mutation
```javascript
// * Vanilla (Older) Redux - DON'T MUTATE STATE
const newState = [...state];
newState.items.push(action.payload);
return newState;

// * Redux Toolkit - Mutating the state is allowed
state.items.push(action.payload);
```

### Part 8: Learning About Redux and Immer.js 📚

- I learned how Redux has evolved to allow direct state mutation using Immer.js, simplifying state management and making the code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Part 9: Redux Developer Tools 🛠️

- We explored the **Redux Developer Tools**, which provide a powerful way to inspect and debug Redux state changes in our application. This tool allows you to:
  - View the current state of the store.
  - Track actions dispatched to the store.
  - Time travel to previous states for debugging.

## 🎉 Conclusion

In this episode, we learned about Redux, its setup, slices, actions, and selectors. We also explored how Redux Toolkit simplifies state management and how to effectively use the Redux Developer Tools. These concepts are essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.
